### Some things to keep in mind:
1. This is for me learning
2. **I DO NOT** claim any of this code as my original as its very similar to Kylie's
3. My documentation sometimes is a little long but hey its mostly for me so don't judge :P
4. Have fun browsing :D

## To open the games from /FreeCodecamp_Games
1. Install tkinter using: <code>brew install python-tk</code>
2. Have fun :D
